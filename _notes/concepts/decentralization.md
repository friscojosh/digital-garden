# Decentralization
A technical and marketing buzzword use amorphously to refer to an unclear set of aspirations about a technology or community. Appeals to decentralization will often involve co-mingling with other loaded or misinterpreted words such as:

* Immutable
* Decentralized
* Trustless
* Secure
* Tamper-proof
* Disintermediated
* Open/Transparent
* Neutral
* Direct transfers of value

Use of term decentralization is often falsely used interchangeably with "democratization", which has an orthogonal meaning.

In information technology it refers to a type of network topology in which a system has no single point of failure and whose workload or actions are performed in parallel by multiple computers which provide a shared service. The internet is the canonical example of a decentralized network.
