## The Australian Securities Exchange dumped its blockchain project

> The Australian Stock Exchange has halted its long-running project to swap out the CHESS settlement and clearing system with blockchain technology, after a scathing independent report from Accenture highlighted a lack of readiness, “complexity in the integrated solutions” and project governance issues.
>
> The project, which has dragged on for seven years, will now be “reassessed”, the ASX stated in a media release this morning, with the abandoned software being “derecognised” at a gross cost of $245 million to $255 million.

The project was only 63 percent complete.

## AWS passed on blockchain

From a blog post by former AWS Engineer Tim Bray

> The questions · We really only had two questions, both for the big-finance players and for the startups. “What is it you want to do?” and “How does blockchain help?”
>
> The answers, to our disappointment, failed to shatter any preconceptions. The things they wanted to do were perfectly reasonable. Some of them were damn exciting. They all needed databases. They could all make use of ledger-like data structures, also cryptographic hashing and signing. But, um, why did they need blockchain? Severe lack of clarity on that.
>
> The key moment was when we got in a room with the CTO of this one startup, in Tribeca I think. When I heard their VC funding number I thought it was the valuation, not the investment dollars. The customer list was blue fucking ribbon and don’t you forget it. These guys were razor-sharp.
> 
> They presented some of the systems they’d built and yep, we were impressed. Then, with the startup CTO in the room, one of my fellow engineers asked the key question: “All these systems, are there any that wouldn’t work without blockchain?” The guy didn’t even hesitate: “No, not really.”
> 
> And that was about that.


> At some point toward the end of this story, I got a call asking me to come down to Seattle. An important customer was coming in for a few days at the Executive Briefing Center; they wanted to hear about Blockchain and someone pointed them at me.
>
> The customer was a very major international agency that you’ve heard of; not sure if they’re big AWS users or were just kicking the tires. In any case, they were being taken very seriously; presentations from a dozen or more product teams stretched over two or three days.
> 
> So I made a presentation about the virtues of ledgers and of cryptographic signatures, mentioned Byzantine generals, and noted that the area was extremely interesting but somewhat unproven in practice.
> 
> Silence fell.
> 
> The customer CIO, an _extremely_ smart person, spoke up, in beautifully-rounded European vowels: “Here’s a use case I’ve been told about that’s on my mind.” He named a region in Asia and explained that the small farmers there mark their landholdings carefully, but then the annual floods sometimes wash the markers away. Then unscrupulous larger landowners use the absence of markers to cut away at the smallholdings of the poorest. “But if the boundary markers were on the blockchain,” he said, “they wouldn’t be able to do that, would they?”
> 
> I thought. Then said “As a lifelong technologist, I’ve always been dubious about technology as a solution to a political problem. It seems a good idea to have a land-registry database but, blockchain or no, I wonder if the large landowners might be able to find another way to fiddle the records and still steal the land? Perhaps this is more about power than boundary markers?”
> 
> Later in the ensuing discussion I cautiously offered something like the following, locking eyes on the CIO: “There are many among Amazon’s senior engineers who think blockchain is a solution looking for a problem.” He went entirely expressionless and the discussion moved on.

## Deloitte found 92 percent of projects abandoned

From a paper by Deloitte, written in November of 2017:

> The stark reality of open-source projects is that most are abandoned or do not achieve meaningful scale. Unfortunately, blockchain is not immune to this reality. Our analysis found that only 8 percent of projects are active, which we define as being updated at least once in the last six months.

## 43 blockchain solution were studied in 2018, none succeeded

Another article by IT and tech website The Register from 2018 reports that in the international development sector there have been zero reported successes with blockchain initiatives.

> a study of 43 solutions advanced in the international development sector has found exactly no evidence of success.
