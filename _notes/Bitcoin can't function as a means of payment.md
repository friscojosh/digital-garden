A simple example shows just how silly the idea is: Imagine trying to purchase an ice cream cone with Bitcoin. Because of the fundamental design of the system, Bitcoin is not scalable. Bitcoin's network of nodes can only process [7 transactions per second](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-blockchain-scalability-problem-the-race-for-visa-like-transaction-speed-5cce48f9d44) *globally* (VIsa can process [over 24,000 transactions per second](https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/retail.html) globally, according to the company). Because of this design choice, transactions takes 10 minutes in the best case, to up to an hour. Your ice cream is now a puddle.
