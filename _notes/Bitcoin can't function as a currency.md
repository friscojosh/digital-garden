Bitcoin fails the test of being money. It's hard to overstate what a massive, existential problem this is for Bitcoin.

Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper is titled [A peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). If Bitcoin is not in fact cash, something is deeply amiss.

Unfortunately for Bitcoin devotees, Bitcoin was designed in such a way that it can't ever live up to Satoshi's claims.

- [[Bitcoin can't function as a means of payment]] 
- [[Bitcoin is not a stable source of value]]
- [[Bitcoin is not a unit of account]]

Then there's the thing where Bitcoin is inherently [[deflationary]]. Deflationary currencies become more scarce as time goes on, leading to hoarding. Hoarding then defeats the entire purpose of a currency, which is to spend it. 

Hoarding also leads to market consolidation and accumulation, which is at odds with goals like decentralization.

Also, somewhat ironically, the monetary policies that allowed for easy access to capital helped to drive interest in crypto, and created billions in phantom wealth for hodlers. This wouldn't be possible if Bitcoin was the world's unit of account.
