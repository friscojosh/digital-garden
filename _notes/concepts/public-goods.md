# Public Goods

Public goods are goods which anyone can use and benefit from, not just those who contribute to the creation and/or upkeep of the good.

* Public goods are non-excludable: anyone can use them.  
* Public goods are non-rival: one person's consumption of the good does not diminish another person's consumption of it.
