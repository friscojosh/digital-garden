Capital control are laws that create friction (a time delay) in capital markets in an attempt to prevent investors from moving their money out of a country during times of financial turmoil.

South Korea is a canonical example in terms of crypto:

> Capital Controls of South Korea

> The government of South Korea implemented capital controls in 2010 stemming from the global financial crisis and the European debt crisis. The measures were designed to reduce the wild fluctuations or volatility in capital flows that may hurt the economy.
>
> The result is a time delay when sending money internationally due to additional administrative burdens. The amount of money that can move out of the country each year is capped, and the transfer must be approved by regulators.
>
> Even if regulators approved the transfer, the process may take so much time that the arbitrage opportunity is no longer available. Capital controls also limit the inflow of cryptocurrencies by foreign investors, which has created a scenario in which South Koreans can only use digital currencies in their country.
