A loose marketing term for alleged blockchain solutions that remove token incentives from the [consensus algorithm](consensus-algorithm.md). 

Permissioned blockchains have been critized as being a rebranding of existing distributed databases or that they offer no advantages over traditional relational database solutions such as Microsoft SQL Server.
