The only stablecoins that can function are those backed 1-to-1 by a target. That target is almost always fiat money such as the US dollar. In other words, no one is running around making a stablecoin pegged to bitcoin since bitcoin is highly volatile.

Any other set up where transactions (called auctions and arbitrage) need to occur to maintain the peg cannot be proven to always work.

Since stablecoins require fiat to maintain their peg, and fiat is centralized, stablecoins can never be decentralized.
