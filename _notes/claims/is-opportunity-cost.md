# Is there an opportunity cost to building crypto?

Crypto companies and projects are draining resources and capital that could be better invested in [productive assets](../concepts/productive-asset.md). Since these assets are [non-economic](../concepts/non-economic.md) they do not produce any net wealth or value for society as a whole, much like buying and holding physical commodities but without the commodities having [any use case or purpose](../concepts/ficticious-commodity.md). 

The crypto project on a whole is therefore a drain on both capital markets and the technology industry since it is consuming time, resources, and talent that could be put towards more productive enterprises.
