## Why do you hate crypto so much, Josh?
---
Many people have asked why I hate crypto. It's a reasonable question. I'm a white dude who likes technology, sports, poker and other gambling-adjacent hobbies. I'm a bro that doesn't conform. 

This digital garden is my partial, but growing answer. It will expand as I add more of my personal notes and research from the past 10 years or so to it. And in the spirit of strong opinions, weakly held, I will question my conclusions when the evidence warrants.

As it stands today, the following are my views on crypto.

I believe crypto is a shitshow. It has been since at least 2014, and solid arguments can be made that smart people should have become disillusioned well before then. I think that the vast majority of people currently investing their money in crypto are either [[charlatans]] or [[rubes]], and that the share of people that do not fall into either of these buckets can be measured in [[basis points]].

On the financial side, I believe the following (click through each for why):
- [[Crypto is an unregulated, feature-incomplete, alternative financial system]]  and like past attempts at creating private money, it will fail due to fraud and speculative bubbles. 
- Bitcoin can't function as a currency. 
- Bitcoin is not a store of value. 
- Crypto assets are not an inflation hedge.
- The leading lights of crypto have more red flags than a Bachelorette contestant.

Unlike some who might agree with the above, however, I also do not think the blockchain is important:
- Crypto is not decentralized. In is, in fact, highly centralized.
- Blackchains solve almost no real world problems. To the extent that blockchain-based solutions can solve a problem, the solutions are inferior and more expensive than what we already have.
- Crypto is not secure. Exploits exist that do not require breaking encryption.

Instead of digital money or the next iteration of the web, crypto is best understood as a gambling product filled with grift and fraud. 

## But why do you care at all? Get a life.

Proponents of crypto make extremely large claims about how crypto will reshape society. I'm a technologist, entrepreneur and a journalist, and the claims largely intersect with my interests. I'm also someone who likes to find the weak points in systems and rules, and then exploit them to my advantage. Some people call this hacking, but to me the label isn't important. What is important is understanding that people like this exist, and they can cause untold damage to society if they behave unethically. 

One of the best things the world did was to funnel people, these so-called hackers, into domains where the effects of their hacks are contained. Sports analytics are a good example. Most sports hacks are ethical, while most financial hacks are unethical. It's far better for the world to have people screaming about the efficiency of the corner three versus having them stealing grandma's retirement savings. 

Anyway, for these reasons crypto was an absolutely fascinating area of study for me in the early days. But, despite what some insist, it's no longer early. And besides, now I realize what crypto actually is.

If crypto were honest about what it is, most would find it completely uninteresting. People have enough experience with casinos to know that beating the house in the long run is a fool's dream. Instead they lie (or at the very best they spread their own self-deception). 

Crypto enthusiasts' messaging serves to target the most vulnerable parts of society. [[Problem gamblers]] especially are disproportionately young and disproportionately come from racial and ethnic minorities.  Preying upon addicts and suckers -- also called "retail" investors -- is how crypto gets its liquidity, and the hucksters on social media encourage these marks to join in on the ponzi or risk missing out on a ride to the moon. 

Promoters of crypto are financial predators. But even those who merely buy into the con are culpable. You can't opt-out of our current economic system in the United States, despite it's numerous flaws. If you don't pay your taxes in US dollars, you'll go to jail. But no one is forcing you to engage with crypto. It's completely voluntary. I'd prefer more people start making the sharp choice. Because if they do, the grifters and charlatans will fail.

Finally, [the Crypto Ponzi Final Boss](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1449334296033075201) once came after me in a 13 tweet thread, so I've got some bias toward seeing these clowns fail.
