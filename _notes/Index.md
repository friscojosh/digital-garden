## Why do you hate crypto so much, Josh?
---
Many people have asked why I hate crypto. It's a reasonable question. I'm a dude who likes technology, sports, poker and other gambling-adjacent hobbies. I'm a bro, but I don't conform

This digital garden is my incomplete, but growing answer. It will expand as I add more of my personal notes and research from the past 10 years or so to it. And in the spirit of [[strong opinions, weakly held]], I will question my conclusions when the evidence warrants.

I believe crypto is a shitshow. It has been since at least 2014, and solid arguments can be made that smart people should have become disillusioned well before then. I think that the vast majority of people investing their money in crypto are either [[charlatans]] or [[rubes]], and that the share of people that do not fall into either of these buckets can be measured in [[basis points]].

People often separate crypto into a couple buckets: the financial side and the technology underpinning things, called blockchain. I will, too.

#### The financialization of everything
On the financial side, I believe (click through each for why):
- [[Crypto is an unregulated, feature-incomplete, alternative financial system]]  and like past attempts at creating private money, it will fail due to fraud and speculative bubbles. 
- [[Bitcoin can't function as a currency]] 
- Crypto assets are not an inflation hedge.
- The leading lights of crypto have more red flags than a Bachelorette contestant.

#### A public spreadsheet you can't delete rows from
Unlike some who might agree with the above, however, I also do not think the blockchain is important:
- Blackchains solve almost no real world problems. And to the extent that blockchain-based solutions can solve a problem, the solution is inferior and more expensive than what we already have.
-  In practice blockchain based projects are not decentralized. They are, in fact, highly centralized.
- Crypto is not secure. Exploits exist that do not require breaking encryption.

### It's speculation and fraud all the way down
Instead of digital money or the next iteration of the web, crypto is best understood as a gambling product filled with fraud. 

## But why do you care at all? Get a life.

### It's in my lane

Proponents of crypto make extremely large claims about how crypto will reshape money, business, the web, even society. The claims intersect with my personal and professional interests.

### It's a drag on society

I'm also interested in systems and rules, where they are weak, and how people might exploit them to their advantage. Some people call this hacking, but the label isn't important. What is important is understanding that people like this exist, and they can cause damage to society if they behave unethically.

One of the smarter things the world did was to funnel hackers into domains where the effects of their actions are contained and mostly productive. Sports analytics are a good example. Most sports hacks are ethical, while most financial hacks are unethical. It's far better for the world to have people screaming online about the efficiency of the corner three versus having them stealing grandma's retirement savings.

Our current system is bad, but crypto is our financial system on meth. It drives people to be the worst, most ethically compromised version of themselves.

Early on there were legitimate reasons for uncertainty. Reasons to wonder if at least some of the wild promises might actually become reality. But, despite what some insist, it's no longer early. And now I realize what crypto actually is.

### It's a predatory casino

If crypto people were honest that it's all just a casino masquerading as a movement, most would find it completely uninteresting. People have enough experience with casinos to know that beating the house in the long run is a fool's dream -- a negative sum game.

But instead of telling the truth, or simply keeping their degenerate gambling to themselves, crypto charlatans target some of the most vulnerable parts of society. [[Problem gamblers]] especially are disproportionately young and disproportionately come from racial and ethnic minorities.  Preying upon addicts and suckers -- also called "retail" investors -- is how crypto gets its liquidity, and the hucksters on social media encourage these marks to join in on the Ponzi or risk missing out on a ride to the moon.

Promoters of crypto are financial predators, and they deserve most of the blame. But even those who merely buy into the con are culpable. You can't opt-out of our current economic system in the United States, despite it's numerous flaws. If you don't pay your taxes in US dollars, you'll go to jail. But no one is forcing you to engage with crypto. It's completely voluntary. I'd prefer more people start making the sharp choice, because if they do, the grifters and charlatans will blow up.

### It's personal

Finally, I should probably mention that [the Crypto Fraud Final Boss](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1449334296033075201) once came after me in a 13 tweet thread, so I've got a bias toward seeing these clowns fail.

That's why I care.
