# Hard Fork
An event when a [cryptoasset](cryptoasset.md) on a [blockchain](blockchain.md) has a divergence in its transaction history and is duplicated into two separate histories. Effectively results in a split of the asset into two versions of itself which are incompatible until either one fork is abandoned or becomes a separate asset all together. 

Most major crypto assets including [bitcoin](bitcoin.md) and [ethereum](ethereum.md) have had hard forks.
