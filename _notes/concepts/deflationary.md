# Deflationary
A deflationary asset is one in which the supply of the asset is decreasing.

Deflationary currencies encourage hording and punish debtors.

[Bitcoin](bitcoin.md) is an example of a deflationary asset due to its total fixed supply and loss of funds due to lost [wallet](wallet.md) or [illicit-financing](illicit-financing.md).

See also [inflationary asset](inflationary.md).
