# Inflationary
A inflationary asset is one in which the supply of the asset is increasing. It is generally desireable for a [currency](currency.md) to have a small predictable amount of deflation on long time periods as this encourages investments in [productive-asset](productive-asset.md) and stimulate economic growth and the creation of jobs. 

The [dollar](dollar.md) is an example of an [asset](assets.md) which is inflationary due to the monetary policy of the [central-banks](central-banks.md).

See also [deflationary asset](deflationary.md).
