# Yield Farming
In crypto assets, *yield farming* is the act of taking [stablecoin](stablecoin.md) and depositing them with different [staking](staking.md) and [DeFi](defi.md) schemes with varying degrees of risk-yield promises in the hopes that diversification across different varieties of [Ponzi schemes](ponzi-scheme.md) will remove risk from an overall portfolio.

See also [counterparty risk](counterparty-risk.md), [Ponzi scheme](ponzi-scheme.md) and [shadow banking](shadow-bank.md).
