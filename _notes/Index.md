## An answer to: "Why do you hate crypto so much, Josh?"
---
Many people have asked why I hate crypto. It's a reasonable question, I suppose. I'm a white dude who likes technology, sports, poker and other gambling-adjacent hobbies. Yet I do not conform. 

This digital garden is my partial, but growing answer. It will expand as I add more of my personal notes and research from the past 10 years or so to it. And in the spirit of strong opinions, weakly held, I will question my conclusions when the evidence warrants.

As it stands today, let me be completely up front on my views.

I believe crypto is a shitshow. It has been since at least 2014, and solid arguments can be made that smart people should have become disillusioned well before then. I think that the vast majority of people currently investing their money in crypto are either [[charlatans]] or [[rubes]], and that the share of people that do not fall into either of these buckets can be measured in [[basis points]].

In terms of the financial side, I believe the following:
- Crypto is an unregulated, alternative financial system, and like past attempts at creating private money, will fail due to fraud and speculative bubbles. 
- I do not think Bitcoin can function as a currency. 
- I do not think Bitcoin is a store of value. 
- I do not believe that crypto assets are an inflation hedge.

And unlike some who might even agree with the above, I also do not think the technology is important, or useful:
- I do not believe that crypto is decentralized. In is, in fact, highly centralized.
- I do not believe that web3 -- whatever that is -- holds any technological promise. 
- In particular I do not believe that applications built upon the Etherium blockchain solve any important real-world problems. 
- To the extent that blockchain-based solutions do solve a problem, the solutions are inferior to centralized solutions.
- I do not believe that crypto is un-hackable. Exploits exist that do not require breaking encryption.

Instead of digital money or the next iteration of the web, crypto is best understood as a massive gambling product filled with grift and fraud. 

If crypto were honest about what it actually is, that might be tolerable for me, because crypto would be completely uninteresting. Most people have enough experience with casinos to know that beating the house in the long run is a fool's dream.

Instead the messaging from crypto enthusiasts serves to target the most vulnerable parts of society. Problem gamblers are disproportionately young and disproportionately come from racial and ethnic minorities. More over the entire crypto ecosystem is zero (or even negative) sum: for me to cash out someone else must cash in. 

Promotes of crypto are financial predators, and even those who merely buy into the con are culpable. You can't opt-out of our current system, despite it's numerous flaws. If you don't pay your taxes in US dollars you'll go to jail. But no one is forcing you to engage with crypto. It's completely voluntary.
