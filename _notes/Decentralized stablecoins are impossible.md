The only stablecoins that can function are those backed 1-to-1 by a target. That target is almost always fiat money such as the US dollar. In other words, if you introduce a stablecoin into your system you are also introducing trust.

Any other set up where transactions (called auctions and arbitrage) need to occur to maintain the peg cannot be proven to always work.

Since stablecoins require fiat to maintain their peg, and fiat is centralized, stablecoins can never be decentralized.
