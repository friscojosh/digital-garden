## An answer to: "Why do you hate crypto so much, Josh?"
---
Many people have asked why I hate crypto. It's a reasonable question, I suppose. I'm a white dude who like technology, sports, poker and other gambling-adjacent hobbies. Yet I do not conform. This digital garden site is my partial, but growing answer. It will expand as I add more of my personal notes and research from the past ten years or so to it. And in the spirit of strong opinions, weakly held, I will questions my conclusions when the evidence warrants.

But as it stands today, let me be completely up front on my views.

I believe crypto is a shitshow. It has been since at least 2014, and solid arguments can be made that smart people should have become disillusioned well before then. I think that the vast majority of people currently investing their money in crypto are either [[charlatans]] or [[rubes]], and that the share of people that do not fall into either of these buckets can be measured in [[basis points]].

In terms of the financial side, I believe the following:
- Crypto is an unregulated, alternative financial system, and like past attempts at creating private money, will fail due to fraud and speculative bubbles. 
- I do not think Bitcoin can function as a currency. 
- I do not think Bitcoin is a store of value. 
- I do not believe that crypto assets are an inflation hedge.

And unlike some who might even agree with the above, I also do not think the technology is important, or useful:
- I do not believe that crypto is decentralized. In is, in fact, highly centralized.
- I do not believe that web3 -- whatever that is -- holds any technological promise. 
- In particular I do not believe that applications built upon the Etherium blockchain solve any important real-world problems. 
- To the extent that blockchain-based solutions do solve a problem, the solutions are inferior to centralized solutions.
- I do not believe that crypto is un-hackable. Exploits exist that do not require breaking encryption.
