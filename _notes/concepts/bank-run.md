# Bank Run
In financial regulation, a bank run is the sudden withdrawal of [deposits](deposit.md) from a [bank](bank.md), which may result in the bank becoming insolvent. 

Bank runs where a common occurrence in United States in the market crash of 1929 and during the 1930s. Regulation and federal policy [deposit insurance](deposit-insurance.md) entirely eliminated this phenomenon in subsequent decades.
