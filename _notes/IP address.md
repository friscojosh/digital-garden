An IP address is given to you by your internet service provider (ISP), is usually shared with other customers of your ISP, and allows those who know it to also know your rough geographical location and the name and address of your ISP. 

An IP address looks like this: `138.199.43.86`

IP addresses can also be combined with cookies and things like email address or other personally identifiable information that you reveal when you sign up for services on the web. In this way robust profiles can be created and ads can be served to you based on your behavior and -- if using a GPS enabled device -- your location. This is the business model of companies like Google and Meta (formerly Facebook).
