# Income Cashflows
Income associated with a financial asset is [money](money.md) that is generated by the terms of the contract. Such as the revenue a [stock](stock.md) company generates from its operations or the rent a piece of real estate can generate.

The discounted cash flow model is a method in quantitative finance of valuing a security, project, company, or asset using the concepts of the time value of money.
