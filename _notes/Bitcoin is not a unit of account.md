This is definitional, and it's probably impossible for Bitcoin to ever be a unit of account without also possessing the two features above. Using the US economy as an example, the government taxes in US dollars, businesses price their goods and services in US dollars, and people pay for things they want in US dollars. Bitcoin never enters the picture. Even in El Salvador Bitcoin is not a unit of account --- people still primarily think about and record values in terms of US dollars.
