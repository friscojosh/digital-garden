# Mining
The technical process of confirming transactions in a [blockchain](blockchain.md) using the proof of work [consensus algorithm](consensus-algorithm.md). Mining is typically centralized by companies known as mining pools which pool physical compute resources in order to increase their probability of confirming blocks.

[Proof of work](proof-of-work.md) mining is an energy intensive process with a large environmental footprint because of its use of fossil fuels to provide energy for data centres.
