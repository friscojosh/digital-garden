# Financial Nihilism
A philosophy on investing and markets in which [value](../value.md) does not exist or is inherently unknowable. The claims of this ideology stems from an underlying belief that [markets](../market.md) have no purpose and cannot, or does not, exist to do [price formation](../price-formation.md) on [assets](../assets.md) because of a belief that [capitalism](../capitalism.md) does not work.

This is a belief system held by some who participate in [meme stock](../meme-stock.md) and [meme coin](../memecoin.md) projects.
