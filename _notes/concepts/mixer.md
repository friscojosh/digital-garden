# Crypto Mixer
A crypto mixer is a [smart contract](smart-contracts.md) service that performs [money laundering](money-laundering.md) for a fee. The service obscures the origin of [illicit funds](illicit-financing.md) to evade detection by law enforcement.  

Crypto mixers are a form of [regulatory arbitrage](regulatory-arbitrage.md).
