# Cross Bridges
In crypto technology a *cross bridge* is a combination of [smart-contracts](smart-contracts.md) across multiple [blockchain](blockchain.md) networks that facilitate interoperability and transactions across different [cryptoassets](cryptoasset.md).

Cross bridges are commonly used for [money laundering](money-laundering.md) transactions in which multiple [cryptoassets](cryptoasset.md) are swapped in a method called *chain-hopping* which is used to obscure the provenance of funds associated with [illicit financing](illicit-financing.md).

See also [DeFi](defi.md) and [money-laundering](money-laundering.md).
