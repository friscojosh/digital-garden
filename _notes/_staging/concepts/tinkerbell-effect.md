# Tinkerbell Effect
The Tinkerbell effect is an expression in psychology and finance to describe things that are thought to exist only because people believe in them. Effectively a shared collective delusion at a critical scale.

This differs from the [network effect](network-effect.md) generated by [financial assets](financial-asset.md) and [currencies](currency.md) whose efficacy is a collective legal fiction that arises out its use as a medium of exchange or investment vehicle.

See also [high-control group](high-control-group.md), [NFT](nft.md), [bandwagon-bias](bandwagon-bias.md) and [endowment-effect](endowment-effect.md).
