# Zero Sum Game
An economic game which involves two sides and where the result is an advantage for one side and a loss for the other. The sum of all gains and losses across all players sums to zero.

Investing in crypto tokens is necessarily a zero sum game before considering the cost of transactions and network maintenance.
